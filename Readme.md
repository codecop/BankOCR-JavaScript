# BankOCR Refactoring Kata

Refactoring kata dealing with Primitive Obsession.

The code is an implementation of the [Bank OCR](https://codingdojo.org/kata/BankOCR/)
as shown by Angela Harms and Jason Felice in their talk [Witness TDD with Real, Live Refactoring Maniacs](https://vimeo.com/111289425)
at Oredev conference 2014. 
This repository started as a clone of the [original code](https://github.com/maitria/ocr-kata).

## Requirements

See the `problem.txt` in the project root.

## Task

The code is fully covered with tests so you can start refactoring it right away.

1. What is wrong with the `OCR` class?
1. Refactor its `parse` method.
1. Consider a future requirement change where the input changes, e.g. the style of digits, number of digits etc.
1. Don't focus on getting it done. Focus on doing it perfectly.
